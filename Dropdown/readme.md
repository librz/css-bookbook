#### naming

name matters when you are referring the UI widget that "drops" down on hover or click

you may refer to dropdown using the following terms:

1. select
2. menu
3. disclosure navigation
4. something else

here's [an article](https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/) explaining it well.

#### native tag

1. \<select> is an html native tag for displaying dropdown, but it's notoriously hard to style
2. \<menu> is another html tag, you may think it's probably a dropdown, but it's not. Ref: [MDN menu tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu)

#### custom dropdown not using the native select tag

TBC
